# Movie Success Prediction

This project uses machine learning to predict how much revenue a movie will earn and whether it will be a "hit" at the box office (defined as over $100 million in revenue).

## Dataset

- Source: TMDB 5000 Movie Dataset (from Kaggle)
- Used features: budget, runtime, release year, genre

## Models Used

- Random Forest Regressor — best model for revenue prediction
- Linear Regression — used for baseline comparison
- Random Forest Classifier — used to predict hit or flop

## Top features: budget, runtime, and release year.

## What’s Inside

- `movie_success_prediction.ipynb` — full notebook with preprocessing, modeling, and evaluation
- `README.md` — project overview

## Future Work

- Add critic reviews, cast/star features, and marketing data
- Try advanced model
- Deploy as a web app
