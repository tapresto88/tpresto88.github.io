## 👨‍🔬 About Me

I'm originally from Iowa (Go Hawkeyes!) and currently based in Denver. After working in clinical lab science for years, I began transitioning into data science to bring a data-driven perspective to problems I've encountered firsthand in the healthcare industry.

I'm passionate about uncovering actionable insights through data. Whether it's modeling movie revenue or analyzing player performance in the NBA, I enjoy building models that not only perform well but also tell a story.

Outside of data, I spend my time rock climbing, hiking, skiing, and planning adventures.

## 🎬 Projects

### 🏥 Early Prediction of Sepsis in ICU Patients

**Overview:**  
Built machine learning models to predict the onset of sepsis using hourly ICU vitals and lab results, with the goal of alerting clinicians before symptoms escalate.

**Technologies:**  
Python, Pandas, Scikit-learn, XGBoost, TensorFlow/Keras (LSTM), Matplotlib, Seaborn

**Highlights:**
- Preprocessed and normalized time-series ICU data from the PhysioNet Sepsis Challenge  
- Conducted exploratory analysis showing vital trends for septic vs. non-septic patients  
- Compared Logistic Regression, XGBoost, and LSTM — **LSTM achieved the highest AUC (0.82)**  
- Key predictors: ↑Respiratory Rate, ↑Heart Rate, ↓Oxygen Saturation

### 🎞️ Predicting Movie Box Office Success

**Overview:** 
Built a machine learning model using the TMDB 5000 Movie Dataset to predict box office revenue and classify movies as financial "hits."

**Technologies:** 
Python, Pandas, Scikit-Learn, Random Forest, Seaborn, Matplotlib

**Highlights:**
- Cleaned and engineered features from raw movie metadata
- Defined hits as movies earning over $100 million
- Achieved RMSE of \$139M and 78% classification accuracy
- Budget and release year were top predictors of success

### 🏀 NBA Player Performance & Salary Analysis

**Overview:** 
This project explores the relationship between player performance metrics and salary data in the NBA. Using historical player-season statistics, I investigated which stats correlate most strongly with player pay.

**Technologies:** 
Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn

**Highlights:**
- Cleaned and merged player salary and performance datasets
- Created visualizations (bar charts, heatmaps) to show trends
- Found strong correlations between salary and points, assists, and total rebounds
- Highlighted top-paid players by season and analyzed possible over/underpaid cases
